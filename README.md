# Projekti_WEB


This is a Web app project that me and my colleague have created as coursework in our second year of university. It is an e-commerce web app that "sells" laptops. It is mostly filled with static data, but it also has dynamic data (you can add, edit, delete users, products, and the activity page that changes depending on the actions of the admin). It has all the necessary pages, like Home, About Us, Products, News, Contact Page, etc. Also, it has a valid login and registration page. Besides this, we also included sessions so that only admins could have access to some specified pages.
